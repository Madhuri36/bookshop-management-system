Bookshop Management System coded using Python and MySQL Queries

This project system includes some facilities for the retail bookshop to maintain records of the books, search, display, and delete the books.
Book  transaction handling is a complex process and it requires a computerized system to maintain overall transactions in an organized way. Due to the heavy demand for books in this competitive world, bookstores must store large amounts of data and  record them.  Also, a bookshop should maintain up-to-date information about the customers. Therefore, this project can help in the management of a bookshop.
